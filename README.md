# A Multi-Objective Ensemble Learning Framework For Designing Low-Carbon Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC)
---
The algorithms used in the study were implemented using Matlab and Python. The relevant parameters of the high-performance platform used for computation are as follows: CPU 8422C (3.0GHz 36c72t) *2, RAM 512G, GPU 4090D *2.

(1) Dataset Construction: Rapidly collect experimental data from extensive literature using computer-aided techniques. (2) Dataset Preprocessing: Use the isolation forest algorithm to detect anomalies, apply synthetic data algorithms to reasonably expand the dataset, and utilize the K-fold cross-validation algorithm to divide the dataset. (3) Regression Prediction: Develop ensemble learning models, use intelligent optimization algorithms to optimize model hyperparameters, evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics, collect external literature for out-of-sample validation, and apply SHAP to analyze model interpretability. (4) Multi-Objective Optimization: Retain the regression prediction model as an implicit objective function, design UHPC mix proportion scenarios, define constraints based on specific scenario requirements, and adopt the stochastic entropy-weighted TOPSIS as the decision-making method for the optimal solution to achieve high mechanical strength, suitable mini-slump, and low-carbon UHPC mix proportions. Finally, evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics and conduct laboratory verification for the optimal solution.
